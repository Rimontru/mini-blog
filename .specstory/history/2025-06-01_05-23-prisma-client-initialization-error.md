Perfect! The Prisma Client has been successfully generated. The error should now be resolved. The client was generated in the `.\lib\generated\prisma` directory.

A few things to note:
1. The Prisma Client has been generated successfully
2. Your existing `lib/prisma.ts` file is correctly set up to use the client
3. The client will be automatically regenerated whenever you make changes to your schema

You should now be able to use Prisma in your application without the initialization error. If you make any changes to your `schema.prisma` file in the future, you'll need to run `prisma generate` again to update the client.

Is there anything specific you'd like to do with Prisma now that the client is generated?
